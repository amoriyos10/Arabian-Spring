\section{Individual Contribution}
\label{sec:individualContrib}

The arising problems during the project were mainly processed and solved by
team work of all the members.  However, due to the large amount of work, the
implementation of the model in \matlab was split into three parts.  Tileman
took care of the network generation, Sebastian wrote the function that
converted the information of the network into an array of agents and Fabian
implemented the solver function.
