# Description: LaPrint is a very powerful tool to convert MATLAB graphics into
#              a eps/tex couple in order to include the graphical output into
#              your LaTeX documentation.  This version of LaPrint is slightly
#              modified compared to the version available at
#              http://www.uni-kassel.de/fb16/rat/matlab/laprint/.  Its
#              modification includes the use of the "textwidth" keyword for
#              relative width in your LaTeX document.  Also, the "filename"
#              parameter to the function is interpreted as a string and does
#              not look for subdirectories.  Thus, it makes sense to use the
#              function in your figure subdirectory of your LaTeX document
#              structure.

* What is it?
  LaPrint is a powerful MATLAB function to generate graphical output which can
  be integrated into LaTeX documents.

* Where can I get it? Documentation?
  http://www.uni-kassel.de/fb16/rat/matlab/laprint/

* Is this version the one I will get from the site above?
  No. I slightly modified this version, since I was not too happy with some of
  its original features.

  - This version allows to use the keyword "textwidth", which was not part of
    the original distribution that only provided the absolute argument "width".
    Textwidth is relative and takes a value between 0 and 1.
    
  - Another modification is the interpretation of the variable "filename".
    This version treats filename as a string and does not follow the path given
    in filename.  The reason for this is LaTeX related, as you often wish to
    place your figures in a subdirectory of your document structure, thus this
    must be accounted for in the path definition of the *.tex output file.  A
    consequence is that the output of LaPrint will be generated in the working
    directory of the function call.

* Example
  The following example plots a cosine function and exports the graphical
  MATLAB output for use with LaTeX to the working directory.  Two files are
  created, namely testFig.tex and testFig.eps.  To include the figure in your
  LaTeX document, use \input{./figs/testFig.tex} in a figure environment.
  #+begin_src matlab
  x = linspace( 0, 2*pi, 1000 );
  y = cos( x );
  plot( x, y );
  laprint( gcf, './figs/testFig', 'textwidth', 0.6 );
  close( gcf );
  #+end_src
