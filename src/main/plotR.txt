This is a short summary in order to make nice Network Plots with R.

In order to plot you have to load each time the library

library('igraph')

To read in the adjacency matrix from a csv file use:
SW <- read.csv('/Users/tilemanconring/Arabian-Spring/src/main/SW.csv', header=F)transform it into a matrix:
mygraph1 <- graph.adjacency(SW, mode="undirected", add.colnames=NA)Plot it. I like the Layout fruchterman.reingold most. Good explanation in the help how the plot is done:
plot.igraph(mygraph1, vertex.size=1,layout=layout.fruchterman.reingold(mygraph1), vertex.label='')

Save the Layout that we
lay <- layout.graphopt(mygraph1)

Now the plot is done by and all the nodes will stay at exactly the same place:
plot.igraph(mygraph1, vertex.size=1,layout=lay, vertex.label='')

In order to give certain nodes and vertices a special color use:
V(mygraph1)[<node IDS>] $color <-'red'
E(mygraph1)[<Edge IDS<] $color <-'blue'

To see something you need to use again the plot command. 

We could read in here a list (be careful Matlab starts with 1 while R with 0 => shift indices) with nodes to be colored and to see a spread of the riots.
